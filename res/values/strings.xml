    <string name="tutorial">Each player (you vs. your infinitely smarter and more superior cell phone) 
        takes turns giving letters that form a word. The last person to give a letter that forms a 
        complete word at least three letters long loses. If a person gives a letter so that a word cannot 
        be formed from the letters, the other player can challenge and the person who gave the letter loses.
